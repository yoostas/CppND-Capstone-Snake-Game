# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
Classes extends via adding new functions. Loops used for UI rendering.

## The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
New classes are added with class attributes and class methods.

## Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
Class attributes and class methods are divided by public and private.

## The project uses scope / Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) where appropriate.
Using of std::unique_lock for locking the mutex.

## The project follows the Rule of 5. 
For Snake class.

## The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
Class Manager is uses smart pinters.
